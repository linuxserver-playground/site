Containers are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `--net=host` | Use Host Networking |
| `-p 3000:3000` | WireShark desktop gui HTTPS, must be proxied. |
| `-p 3001:3001` | WireShark desktop gui HTTPS, only use this if you are not using host mode and sniffing Docker network traffic. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Etc/UTC` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |
| `-v /config` | Users home directory in the container, stores program settings and potentially dump files. |
| `--shm-size=` | Recommended for all desktop images. |
| `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` | Required to allow packet capture. |

### Portainer notice

This image utilises `cap_add` or `sysctl` to work properly. This is not implemented properly in some versions of Portainer, thus this image may not work if deployed through Portainer.
